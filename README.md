## Description

This is a simple color coded work day planner. There are time-blocks from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM for typical work hours. These 
time-blocks are color coded for representation of past, present, and futer tasks. Past task's background colors are gray, present task's background colors are red, and future task's background colors are green.
